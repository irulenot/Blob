# Blob
Simple game using ML

Design
  1) You play a game with a ball that jumps up and down past some randomly generated posts  
    a) Built with Pygame
  2) Your jumps are logged and transformed into data for a model  
    a) Unsure what I'm going to use
  3) You watch a ML model jump over ledges based on your performance  
    a) Probably with scikit-learn
