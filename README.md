  1) You play a game with a ball that jumps up and down past some randomly generated posts \n
    a) Built with Pygame
  2) Your jumps are logged and transformed into data for a model \n
    a) Unsure what I'm going to use
  3) You watch a ML model jump over ledges based on your performance \n
    a) Probably with scikit-learn
